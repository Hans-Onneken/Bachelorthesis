uses the same concept of buying selling and renting the books but with some little modification. In this platform we will help student’s rent and sell their books to other students by connecting them with each other with this platform. We are not serving as a retailer and we will not buy sell and rent any books, we will just help students by providing this platform. Students will chose the books and their prices, and for that we will also provide the price compare feature so that a student can chose the best price for books. Now the question is  how does this platform works, it is so simple you just sign up, select the text books that you have and want to rent and sell, select the price, and you are done. Now when someone orders your book you just pack the book, print a prepaid slip from the website, stick it and mail it. Whoever rent or buy your books you will get the money and by renting you will get your books back after some time and you will be ready to rent these books again. Thanks for backing this project and see the rewards section for reward details. It is a platform that provide website features to all the students to buy, sell or rent their books notes or any other college material to other college students.After buying the books and using it only one time or only for one semester students have only two options either keep the books at home on a bookshelf to collect dust or either sell it to a major retailers for the cast of pennies.One day I though how can I still keep all of my books that I have and also can make some money out of these books, with that thought in my mind I tried to rent my text books to my other class mates and it worked so I made a little money and I still have these books.On that day I came up with the idea to provide individual students a platform to either buy, sell or rent their books to other students and make money out of the books. So I launched the website www.booksplatform.com\n","Original theme of the site                 Story behind booksplatformOne day I was sitting in my room, and looking at the bookshelf which is full of text books and started thinking what should I do with these books. I thought how can I still keep all of these books and can also make some money out of these books, with that thought in my mind, one day I decided to rent the books as an individual college student to other individual college students. When I rented the books I told the guys if you return the books to me at the end of the semester I will give you half the money back that you paid me. When the semester ended the guy contacted me and returned the books to me by that way I made a little money and I still have the books. So I decided rather than renting the books from other retailers student should rent books to each other. By this way students can make a little money from all the books that they have at home.Work in process theme                 How dose booksplatform.com works?Sign Up and you are ready to use it.You choose the books and the selling or renting price for those books.This website is a solid platform with all the features to connect individual students with each other to buy, sell or rent their books.This website is completely free and independent of any retailers.We do not buy, sell or rent any books or college material, we just provide a platform to connect students.  How far along I am on this project?  I started this project one months ago and now I am half way to this project. This website is already online and you can check the website any time but it is not finished yet and I have already put my money in it and now I need your help to finish this project and make it a reality to help students make some money form the books that they have at home.Who am I?Hello! kick starter, this is Usman Jamil, and I am a computer major student.

The Nandi Bear has evolved and adapted to the 21st century.  He now thoroughly enjoys tracking books and even has his own website! NandiBear.com is a remarkable and exceptional place and where humans and Nandi Bears work together with the following objectives:  •    Track books as they travel the planet (see where they've been!)           •    Keep the Nandi Bear informed and up-to-date.  He likes to know where his books are presently located!  •    Read book reviews written by members of the Nandi Bear community!  •    Write book reviews, let the Nandi Bear know what you think about your book.  •    Rate books using the Nandi Bear's 10 star system. What is the 10 star system?  We believe that 10 stars (as opposed to 5 stars) help readers to effectively and accurately rate books that they've read. With time we believe that book lovers will flock to our website to read our accurate reviews when considering whether or not to purchase or read a book. Why? It's our position that the 5 star system book rating system, found elsewhere, may be mathematical accurate but is not aesthetically accurate. For example, 7 stars (out of 10) emanates more effectively than 3.5 stars (out of 5).  How do you track books? At our website (NandiBear.com) you will be able to apply for a Nandi Bear Passport for your book (any book, you don't have to be the author). You'll need information such as the book's title, edition, printing, current location of book (e.g., city, state and country) and a scan of the cover of your copy of the book. Why do we ask for a scan of the book cover? A book cover is a memory, it's as much a part of the book as is the content between the covers. In the publishing world book covers are updated and sometimes swapped out for wholly new designs. When a reader spots a particular cover that they remember they experience a pleasant and fulfilling connection with the book. You'll also need a printer, a sheet of adhesive printer paper and something to cut with (scissors or some sort of paper trimmer). Here is our very first Nandi Bear Passport being trimmed and affixed to the inside cover of one of the books in our personal library:                                 Each passport sticker will bear a unique Nandi Bear Passport Number. At the website (NandiBear.com) you'll enter the current location of the book (city, state and country) and as much other relevant data as you would like. If you ever sell, donate or lose your book you can also add this information to the book's online passport. When the new owner of the book opens the cover and sees the Nandi Bear Passport sticker they too are directed to our website (NandiBear.com) and can add the new location of the book. They can also record where they found/bought the book at or how they came to possess the book. As a book travels the planet, from owner to owner, or old location to new location (same owner), NandiBear.com will keeping a record of their passport for all of us to see! Readers can also post reviews of the books that they see being tracked at NandiBear website. Our website is up but we need your help ($$$) to build the book tracking application and our database. What you currently see at frontend of the NandiBear.com website is, at very best (if you grant us a little latitude and are in a generous mood!), our minimum viable product. We'd also like to develop the site so that readers can upload PDFs of hard to find books and booklets which are both no longer under copyright and not yet found online. We own these sorts of old books and booklets and in the past we've experimented with uploading them to sites such as Srcibd. We've also encountered problems at Scribd and found that uploads were sometimes replaced, by Scribd, with other versions that were later found elsewhere online. We've also had uploads removed by Scribd. The NandiBear needs your help developing NandiBear.com! All pledges will be applied to: - Developing the book tracking application - Building a database - Developing a Scribd-like document upload addition to the site. We hope that Darwin Studios in Atlanta, Georgia will be a component of this project.

Books should never be thrown out when others can continue to enjoy their stories for many more years.  \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the money used for?  \t\t\t\t\t\tWe are asking for your help in funding the website and app. The money donated will be used for creating and maintaining the site and app. It will also go towards purchasing books for the site. We want to make sure there is a selection of good books that people want to read. Everyone has a different preference of what they like to read, so we want to have all types of books available from the start, whether they be fiction, nonfiction, poetry, history, educational, religious, children’s books, etc!  \t\t\t\t\t\tThough we have experience in programming on web and app platforms, some of the funds will be used to recruit others to help build the site. The goal is to have BookCoin available on the web, for iOS in beta form by early 2015, with an Android app to follow.  \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the \"coin\" system?  \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tThe strength of BookCoin lies in the coin system. Each coin is worth one book; you get a coin for sending a book and use a coin to get a new book. Coins never expire, and books on the catalogue are available on a first come first serve basis, meaning no waiting lists! The coin system promotes a catalogue of quality books. One has the incentive to post books others want because they receive a coin for only the books they send out. Don’t see a book you want right now? Don’t worry: the catalogue is always changing and expanding.  \t\t\t\t\t\tThe coin system is unique to any other trading site and provides lots of benefits. Trading using a coin system allows for a large catalogue of books to chose from and provides a safe, fair environment. Shipping is always paid by the requester of the book, and a shipping label is emailed to the sender. Because one cannot purchase more books then they have coins, it ensures that users will spend their coins wisely and also be encouraged to list quality books.  \t\t\t\t\t\tOnce a user requests a book, his coin is put into a waiting system. The coin is then transferred to the sender once the book is shipped and marked “received” or after a reasonable time after being shipped.  \t\t\t\t\t\tIs it free and secure?  \t\t\t\t\t\tThis website is free to join and all your information will be kept safe and secure! We will never give out any of your information without your consent.  \t\t\t\t\t\tIs BookCoin expandable?  \t\t\t\t\t\tBookCoin will provide an expandable base for a large group of users. The more users there are, the more books that are listed and the better opportunity to find exactly what you are looking for. Books and corresponding coins will initially be offered by the funds raised and coins will be given to supporters of BookCoin to use on books of their choosing.        \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat experience do we have that will help us implement this project?  \t\t\t\t\t\tKevin has a BS in Mathematics and a minor in chemistry. He has experience in programming on web platforms, programming for Android, for iOS, and for embedded micro controllers in assembly language and in C. Kevin’s experience as president of the Math Club in college has given him administrative and team leading experience that will benefit this project. \t\t\t\t\t\tNicole is a Senior in college working on a BA in English with a concentration in creative writing. She loves books and has a vision for a free, easy to use book trading platform. Nicole has lots of books she wants to trade, but has not found a good, online platform to do so. This is where BookCoin comes in! \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is our vision for BookCoin in the future?  \t\t\t\t\t\tOur vision for the future of BookCoin is to see a great site and app expand into something book lovers use and adore. Our hope is that a successful site and app will allow us to give more coins to dedicated users as we personally upload more books to the catalogue. We may also introduce a BookCoin market for T-Shirts, bookmarks, and notebooks on the website! \n","processed Description: ['bookcoin', 'goal', 'fair', 'book', 'trading', 'experience', 'web', 'app', 'platform', 'concept', 'coin', 'coin', 'book', 'book', 'others', 'shipping', 'requester', 'prepaid', 'shipping', 'label', 'sender', 'bookcoin', 'shirt', 'design', 'vision', 'vision', 'trading', 'book', 'everyone', 'something', 'something', 'book', 'list', 'book', 'book', 'others', 'story', 'year', 'money', 'help', 'website', 'money', 'site', 'app', 'towards', 'book', 'site', 'selection', 'book', 'people', 'everyone', 'preference', 'type', 'book', 'start', 'nonfiction', 'poetry', 'history', 'child', 'book', 'web', 'app', 'platform', 'fund', 'others', 'site', 'goal', 'web', 'beta', 'form', 'app', 'coin', 'system', 'strength', 'bookcoin', 'lie', 'coin', 'system', 'coin', 'book', 'book', 'use', 'coin', 'book', 'coin', 'book', 'catalogue', 'basis', 'coin', 'system', 'catalogue', 'quality', 'book', 'incentive', 'book', 'others', 'coin', 'book', 'book', 'catalogue', 'coin', 'system', 'trading', 'site', 'lot', 'benefit', 'coin', 'system', 'catalogue', 'book', 'environment', 'shipping', 'requester', 'book', 'shipping', 'label', 'sender', 'book', 'coin', 'user', 'coin', 'quality', 'book', 'request', 'book', 'coin', 'system', 'coin', 'sender', 'book', 'time', 'website', 'information', 'secure', 'information', 'consent', 'bookcoin', 'base', 'group', 'user', 'user', 'book', 'opportunity', 'book', 'coin', 'fund', 'coin', 'supporter', 'bookcoin', 'book', 'experience', 'project', 'kevin', 'mathematics', 'minor', 'chemistry', 'experience', 'web', 'platform', 'android', 'micro', 'controller', 'assembly', 'language', 'experience', 'president', 'math', 'club', 'college', 'experience', 'project', 'nicole', 'college', 'concentration', 'writing', 'book', 'vision', 'easy', 'book', 'trading', 'platform', 'nicole', 'lot', 'book', 'online', 'platform', 'bookcoin', 'vision', 'bookcoin', 'vision', 'future', 'bookcoin', 'site', 'expand', 'something', 'book', 'lover', 'hope', 'site', 'app', 'coin', 'user', 'book', 'catalogue', 'bookcoin', 'market', 'shirt', 'bookmark', 'notebook', 'website', 'w', 'e', 'b', '_', 's', 'i', 't', 'e', 'coin_coin']\n","\n","\n","Document 165080:\n","[(7, 0.06136042), (8, 0.019520942), (17, 0.034728255), (33, 0.08402341), (34, 0.086010166), (49, 0.1922161), (50, 0.038589634), (55, 0.018269837), (65, 0.026055314), (69, 0.03397656), (72, 0.04649106), (76, 0.093123324), (79, 0.06664743), (84, 0.039426003), (85, 0.018191911), (87, 0.014936644)]\n","Topic Probability: 0.19221609830856323\n","Project Description: I am currently a college student in California. I work a Full time job and go to school so my schedule is very busy. I work so hard because I have to pay for college fully out of my pocket. Tuition is getting higher and so are the prices of books. I came up with Mooch-A-Book a mobile app that students can open and see who is selling, renting, or even letting people borrow books out. This is to help students who don't have much money to buy books or people that don't want to pay for a brand new book at a high price. The app will have the books of all the classes the school offers. This will be an area where someone can mooch a book off someone for very cheap or for free. Many people have books at home not being used this app will help them sell those books. It will also help people who don't want to spend thousands of dollars on brand new books they will barely use. While going to school there were many classes that I took that I bought a book for 200 and we only used it twice. That really made me frustrated and I wish I could've just borrowed that book instead. With this app it'll be easier to find someone who will let you borrow the book for very cheap or for free. I have a lot of friends that end up dropping classes or end up dropping out of school because it is becoming expensive to pay for everything. With this app I want to help everyone get an education that they need. Please join me in helping everyone receive the education they deserve. This app will be very successful with the more people that have it. Thank you in advance for the pledges.\n","processed Description: ['college', 'student', 'california', 'work', 'time', 'job', 'school', 'schedule', 'work', 'college', 'pocket', 'tuition', 'price', 'book', 'mooch', 'book', 'app', 'student', 'people', 'book', 'student', 'money', 'book', 'people', 'brand', 'book', 'price', 'app', 'book', 'class', 'school', 'area', 'someone', 'book', 'someone', 'people', 'book', 'home', 'app', 'book', 'people', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'brand', 'book', 'school', 'class', 'book', 'book', 'app', 'someone', 'book', 'lot', 'friend', 'class', 'school', 'everything', 'app', 'everyone', 'education', 'everyone', 'education', 'app', 'people', 'advance', 'pledge', 'm', 'o', 't', 'o', 'r', '_', 'm', 'o', 't', 'o', 'r', 'college_student']\n","\n","\n","Document 189462:\n","[(1, 0.010498748), (8, 0.051784422), (16, 0.075598836), (19, 0.013276877), (20, 0.0443029), (31, 0.024736919), (33, 0.010107031), (40, 0.01616058), (41, 0.016352264), (42, 0.10219235), (48, 0.064276725), (49, 0.18275893), (63, 0.010809873), (69, 0.049211822), (76, 0.031049786), (79, 0.020834584), (85, 0.0124842655), (88, 0.057089068), (89, 0.014006481), (90, 0.017102428), (92, 0.0111923665), (93, 0.015910286), (95, 0.010412095), (96, 0.013382558)]\n","Topic Probability: 0.18275892734527588\n","Project Description:      CURRENT AND NEW BACKERS, VISIT THE NEW CAMPAIGN HERE               Click the red button above to have access to images and videos made for the promotion of Repair X on your blog or website.           Introducing the new patent pending Repair X.

You can buy separate repair guides as you need them and use the same magnetic tray.           X-ray mode is a version of the repair guide that has been simplified with all the descriptions and details removed so you can simply make notes. (Advanced technicians typically prefer the simpler version when doing repetitive repairs with the same type of device).          The magnetic tray is designed to slide a repair guide into, to make the guide magnetized for holding screws, parts, and other objects in place on top of the labels that the repair guide lays out.                      The tray consists of three layers, a top layer made of transparent PVC plastic, boarder and magnetic layer. The top layer has a coating that allows an erasable marker to write on the surface and has a cutout to allow for the repair guide to be easily removed. Underneath this layer is the magnetic layer that holds screws securely against the repair guide.         While the RepairX is an amazing tool for everyone’s repair needs, the people who will get the most out of this product will be repair schools, Do-it-yourself enthusiasts who prefer to repair their own devices, or repair stores for reference for experienced techs or for training new interns. Since Repair X will be available for computers and game systems as well as smartphones and tablets, this product could revolutionize the entire electronics repair industry as a whole.                     You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Repair X is not only larger than ScrewMat, but it contains much more detail and color coded screws per separate repair, so you only remove screws you need for a specific repair.                      Each guide will have labels that name the part and point to where it came from (or where is should go).           For those times when you get a screw mixed up, you can easily refer to the length of screw next to each screw label to make sure you have the right screw for the right place.           More complex repairs need more details. No detail is too small. Repair X has that covered.           Never be left wondering if you have the right guide for the right device. The top right corner shows an image of the device so you won't have to guess.        Screws are color coded, so you only remove the screws you need for a specific repair.           \"X-RAY MODE\" is on the reverse side of the repair guide. This allows experienced technicians to just focus on the screw locations and allows notes to be written on the writable surface of the magnetic tray.          As you can see, Repair X takes the best features out of the top three other repair mats and combines them into one product. Repair X also has other features that no other repair based product on the market can match. (Repair X guides will later be accompanied by detailed videos that go along with each guide)          These are the repair guides that will be available immediately when Repair X is ready for retail.            Devices will not be limited to just phones and tablets. Repair guides will also include Laptops (mostly MacBooks) and game systems (both portable and consoles along with their controllers) with retro (old school) game systems coming later. These repair guides above will be made over time throughout the rest of 2016.          HOW REPAIR X WAS BORNThe idea came to me during the first months of being hired at a repair store when a co-worker gave me a screwmat to repair an iPhone 4. I liked the fact that the screw mat showed you where the screws came from in order to make disassembly/reassembly much easier, but it still couldn’t help me when I wanted to do a specific repair since it shows the screws for the entire phone, not just for a specific repair. For an example, the iPhone 4 screen repair is considered the hardest iPhone repair to do since it requires disassembling the entire phone. The iPhone 4 is built in layers. The screw mat only shows where all the screws go, it never shows how to take off each part to get to the screen. So in the case of the iPhone 4, the screw mat was useless. So I analyzed how the iPhone was supposed to be taken apart and made an exploded view of the iPhone. I labeled each part in order and drew lines from where the screws should come from. Suddenly, I realized that this was the best way to display a complex layered repair. Suddenly, the beginnings of a better screw mat were made. I applied this to all iPhones and eventually I will make more for iPads and other devices using the same visual aid. My dream is to have this repair kit made for many more consumer electronics and be used by all repair stores and technical schools across the world.           I am a skilled technician, graphic designer, photographer, published author and inventor with a passion for all things technology. After disassembling, repairing and diagnosing various electronics from game systems to computers over the last several years, I eventually formed my own product to aid the tech repair industry.\n","processed Description: ['backer', 'campaign', 'button', 'access', 'image', 'video', 'promotion', 'repair', 'blog', 'patent', 'repair', 'screw', 'device', 'incorporates', 'repair', 'guide', 'bird', 'backer', 'edition', 'version', 'repair', 'tray', 'repairx', 'action', 'html5', 'browser', 'play', 'replay', 'play', 'tray', 'guide', 'style', 'outline', 'device', 'marker', 'repair', 'guide', 'tray', 'ray', 'mode', 'version', 'repair', 'guide', 'description', 'detail', 'note', 'technician', 'simpler', 'version', 'repair', 'type', 'device', 'tray', 'repair', 'guide', 'screw', 'part', 'object', 'place', 'top', 'label', 'repair', 'guide', 'tray', 'layer', 'layer', 'pvc', 'plastic', 'boarder', 'layer', 'layer', 'marker', 'surface', 'repair', 'guide', 'underneath', 'layer', 'layer', 'screw', 'repair', 'guide', 'repairx', 'tool', 'everyone', 'repair', 'people', 'product', 'school', 'device', 'repair', 'store', 'reference', 'tech', 'intern', 'repair', 'computer', 'game', 'system', 'smartphones', 'tablet', 'product', 'electronics', 'repair', 'industry', 'html5', 'browser', 'play', 'replay', 'play', 'repair', 'guide', 'iphone', 'screwmat', 'iphone', 'repair', 'screwmat', 'detail', 'color', 'screw', 'repair', 'screw', 'repair', 'guide', 'label', 'part', 'point', 'time', 'length', 'screw', 'label', 'right', 'screw', 'place', 'repair', 'detail', 'detail', 'repair', 'guide', 'device', 'right', 'corner', 'image', 'device', 'screw', 'color', 'screw', 'repair', 'mode', 'side', 'repair', 'technician', 'location', 'note', 'surface', 'tray', 'feature', 'repair', 'mat', 'product', 'repair', 'feature', 'repair', 'product', 'market', 'repair', 'guide', 'video', 'guide', 'repair', 'repair', 'device', 'phone', 'tablet', 'guide', 'laptop', 'macbooks', 'game', 'system', 'console', 'controller', 'school', 'game', 'system', 'repair', 'guide', 'time', 'rest', 'repair', 'idea', 'month', 'repair', 'store', 'worker', 'screwmat', 'iphone', 'fact', 'screw', 'mat', 'screw', 'order', 'repair', 'screw', 'phone', 'repair', 'example', 'iphone', 'screen', 'repair', 'iphone', 'repair', 'phone', 'iphone', 'layer', 'screw', 'screw', 'part', 'screen', 'case', 'iphone', 'screw', 'mat', 'iphone', 'view', 'iphone', 'part', 'order', 'line', 'screw', 'way', 'repair', 'beginning', 'screw', 'mat', 'iphones', 'ipads', 'device', 'aid', 'dream', 'repair', 'kit', 'consumer', 'electronics', 'repair', 'store', 'school', 'world', 'designer', 'author', 'inventor', 'passion', 'thing', 'technology', 'repairing', 'electronics', 'game', 'system', 'computer', 'year', 'product', 'repair', 'industry', 'p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'i', 'n', 'g', '_', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'u', 'a', 'g', 'e', 'repair_guide']\n","\n","\n","Document 133467:\n","[(7, 0.03900098), (8, 0.013782487), (9, 0.013351211), (11, 0.010800137), (12, 0.034994904), (15, 0.05017468), (16, 0.05796344), (20, 0.019884864), (21, 0.011457668), (23, 0.032601688), (33, 0.012404573), (40, 0.017965412), (41, 0.021706978), (43, 0.046517473), (49, 0.18109594), (51, 0.019751817), (52, 0.06171922), (56, 0.011917388), (58, 0.01100157), (60, 0.01549283), (77, 0.011930531), (79, 0.04314504), (84, 0.011036186), (88, 0.013831528), (93, 0.043739706)]\n","Topic Probability: 0.1810959428548813\n","Project Description: What is The Hawaii Project?There’s an ocean of books out there. Avid readers are buried in choices and it’s hard to find the great stuff. How do you find the books that are right for you?Imagine a bookstore where every book in the store is specifically selected to match your interests. A bookstore that knows what kind of books you read and what authors you love.A service that’s always on the lookout for you. Magically finding interesting books you'd never have found on your own. A service that brings things to you, so you don't have to go looking. Imagine an assistant that tells you when your favorite author puts out a new book, so you never miss out. Or better still, tells you when they recommend a book they love. Imagine a place that’s not just books – that could immerse you in a world of books, articles, cover art, blog posts from your favorite authors, even photos and videos about authors and books you'll be interested in. Imagine a company that donated 10% of their (post Kickstarter) revenue to help the less fortunate get and love books.Welcome to The Hawaii Project.The Hawaii Project will fundamentally alter how you find out about great books, and change your idea of what book recommendations can be. You won't be satisfied with \"People who bought this also bought that\" anymore, or just a list of books. You'll want more. Do you love wandering into your favorite bookstore and checking out the \"Staff Recommends\" shelf? Giddy when you discover a cool book on a topic you're interested in? Irritated to find out your favorite author released a new book and nobody told you? Tired of Amazon telling you \"people who bought this also bought that\"? Especially after you just bought presents for your friend's toddler, so all your recommendations are now board books? Tired of looking at postage-stamp sized cover art and 50 gazillion reviews by people you don't know?Us too. We're different.How does it work?Simple. Tell us what authors and books you love; tell us your interests and what genres you love, and every day you'll get a gorgeous, browsable set of books and articles you'd never have found on your own that match your interests. And our surprisingly informative daily email with picks curated just for you.   Some recommendations from The Hawaii Project      Ratings and Reviews are tired and broken. Anybody can jump on a site and leave a 5 star (or a 1 star) review. There's not much effort involved. And those reviews, do they come from people like you? Just because I think this is a 5 star book doesn't mean you will! And what do you do with a book with 40,000 reviews on a big book review site (seriously!)? Read all 40,000 of them?We've taken a different approach. We start by learning about you. What authors you love, what books you've read, what books you want to read, and what topics and genres interest you. Then we marry the insight of human curation with the power of modern algorithms.We've curated a slice of the web for high quality writing about books. High profile sites like major newspaper sites. Niche book blogs about medieval history or paranormal romance. And everything in between. If somebody takes the time to write a blog post about a book, that book meant something to them, and will mean something to other like-minded people. We're crawling the books blogosphere for books to figure out what people are writing about - Google crawls for web pages, we crawl for Books. We take the books we've found (and the articles about them), mash them together with your personal interests, run it through our algorithms and discover great books for you, that you'd never find on your own.  As you interact with The Hawaii Project, we learn even more about you. You can mark books you've Read, Love or Want, to make a gorgeous TBR list or show off your favorite books. Our initial recommendations will be great, and they'll get even better the more you use us. And, our recommendations understand what people are writing about NOW. So, if a movie based on a book was just released, or a book is about something in the news, THP will pick that up. If it's relevant to you, we'll include it in your recommendations.Each book has a dedicated page to give you all kinds of interesting info. Is the book is in your local library? Can you can read it for free at the Open Library? We'll tell you. And you'll see articles about that book, and a list of related books that will be of interest. The articles we find will give you a great perspective about the book. And we'll also show you ALL the books mentioned in the article, so you can see other books mentioned along with the book. It's a great way to find related books that will be of interest.

It’s probably the most efficient tool for educating yourself every morning.\" - TJ, Salt Lake City\"I don't read much....but when I tried The Hawaii Project I saw all these cools books and suddenly I wanted to read!\" - LT, Michigan\"...HawaiiProject has developed a way to magically figure out what books you might be missing that you'd be interested in... And I love the book site source list - what a treasure trove!\" - KJ, Los Angeles\"I can cruise across the titles the same way I would cruise by them in a book store. If the cover and blurb interest me, I can pick it up by clicking on it. The books are random enough that it’s visually very interesting to see what’s there, and because what is presented to me is sorted by my taste, the majority of the books appeal to me. I like the freedom of not being talked to by stars, advocates, or paid critics. I like being “unfettered”. I’m tired of lists and ratings. But I do appreciate the filter that THP uses. It works for me.\" - LT, Salt Lake CityDon't you want to be part of something like this? Join us, and Do Good by Reading Well.Books Change Lives. Help share your love of books with others. Reading and literacy are powerful forces for good. We started The Hawaii Project to share our love of books and to use entrepreneurship to create an engine to generate cold hard cash that we'll share with deserving literacy non-profits. So the less fortunate of us can still grow to love books and learning.       You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

As we generate revenue, we'll donate 10% quarterly to them. (To be clear, your Kickstarter contribution to THP DOES NOT go to these organizations – that is prohibited by Kickstarter rules, and not why we're raising money. Your contributions help us get The Hawaii Project on the market. Only future subscriptions done outside of Kickstarter will generate funding for those organizations).Our basic service is free. We generate revenue through subscriptions and premium features that some users will choose to pay for. We share 10% before anything else. Before salaries, before servers, or anything else. We're funding the rest. A successful, self-sustaining for-profit enterprise committed to social good is one of the most durable ways to fund a social mission. Help us make The Hawaii Project a going concern.Find great books with The Hawaii Project. Support some great organizations to help others. Do Good by Reading Well.What's the project status and why are we asking for money?There's some rocket science web crawling and information theory going on here. But we've been doing that for 15+ years so it's not that scary. We've got a working proof-of-concept system and getting rave reviews from people using it.But we're currently one person (we're using the word \"we\" loosely 8)). Your backing will enable us to finish the development of The Hawaii Project and get it on the market in a robust, scalable way. Your donations help by paying for servers and making the system production ready for thousands or millions of book lovers. We'll hire a professional designer to make a user experience so gorgeous you'll want it for a screen saver, and so easy to use you'll forget it's there. It will let us hire people and fund development of our premium features, so we can begin generating revenue to share back. As a donor, you'll get early access to the system and can help us shape the future of the service.  The Hawaii Project will continue to evolve - new features, social capabilities, even better recommendations, more content, going mobile, and many other things - we'd love your perspective!The RewardsYou can read about the awards to your right, but here's some of the actual physical THINGS you can get (note: we're still refining the precise designs for the T-Shirts but this is what we're currently planning):   As part of the Big Kahuna reward: our long sleeve Hoodie Tshirt         For the Kahuna reward, a soft, Next Level Triblend Tshirt         Ohana reward: 2-sided The Hawaii Project bookmark      Check out our truly unique Personal Shopper reward. After you sign up and input your book interests, every month for 3 months we'll send you two interesting, unique books matching your interests you wouldn't have found own your own. (they'll be used books but if you've read 'em or don't like 'em we'll replace them!).But the real reward is that great feeling you’ll get knowing you’re helping spread the love of books to people who might otherwise not get it. I see some rewards for Authors and Publishers - I'm an author...what's in it for me?The Hawaii Project provides you an easy way to stay in touch with your audience, and grow a new audience, simply by doing what you're probably already doing. We'll create a gorgeous Founding Author page, showing you, your bio, your books, your blog posts, news about you, and your book recommendations. You can see a mockup of what this page looks like below. (It's a preliminary design and may change in some details.)   A Sample Founding Author Page    When someone expresses interest in your books on The Hawaii Project, they'll be added to your list of followers. Once we know about your blog, readers who follow you will get notified whenever you post. Any books you recommend on your blog will also get passed along. And they'll be able to see your twitter feed as well, increasing the odds they'll follow you on twitter. The good news is you don't have to do much of anything. Once your blog is registered in The Hawaii Project, the rest is automatic! Sign up for the Author award and we'll set you up!If you're a Publisher, your reward is a macro version of that, for all your books and authors.(oh - Why do we call it The Hawaii Project?)The name started as a play on The Manhattan Project - we're doing some serious science here to bring you great books.  For us, there’s nothing better than relaxing on the beach with a great book.  And we have a deep connection to Hawaii (a lot of this is getting built in Kailua, HI), and well, we just love our time on the beach reading great books and want you to have some too!(Sometimes when we're in a hurry we'll refer to The Hawaii Project as THP. )ThanksMahalo to Maui native Will Weston for the use of clips from his songs Quiet Sparks and One Step.\n","processed Description: ['hawaii', 'project',

0.17885224521160126\n","Project Description: Find for AR an Accelerated Reader(tm) phone app  Accelerated Reader(tm) is a software program used by elementary, middle and high schools throughout the United States to test students on books that they have read.  Unlike traditional testing where a student reads a book, writes a book report and then submits it to their teacher for review, Accelerated Reader(tm) grades the student based on a quiz they take after they read a book. There are thousands of books in the Accelerated Reader(tm)  library that students can choose from to read.  This helps promote reading as the student gets to choose what they read, rather than being assigned a book that may not hold any interest for them.  It also makes grading more accurate because the teacher does not have to be familiar with the books the student is reading. At the beginning of a semester, students are given a total amount of reading points they need to achieve in that nine weeks.  Each book has a maximum point value assigned to it.  Points are then given to the student based on how they do when they test on the book. What does Find for AR do? Find for AR is a smart phone application that allows students, parents, and teachers search for books that can be tested on for Accelerated Reader(tm).  By simply entering the name of the book, the user will be able to see information that they need.  The information includes the amount of points the book is worth, the grade level that the book is ideal for, a summary of the book, and a picture of the cover (which helps if there are different versions of the book). The free ad supported version of our app has the following limitation: Books can only be found by doing a search of the title, author or ISBN number  \n","Our premium version of the app will include additional functionality to include: \n","  Advance search which includes title, author, ISBN, Quiz Release Date, Quiz Type, Interest Level, ATOS book level, Topic/subtopic, Fiction/Non-Finction and English/Spanish filters   \n","The ability to scan in a bar code rather than type the book name  \n","Mark a book as a favorite so you can go back to it later on \n"," Offline Mode offers the ability to download parts of the database to your smart phone so you can look up information while off line\n","  A 5 star rating system of each book based on how other users rate the books   \n"," No advertisements\n","\n","   What makes Find for AR better than any other Accelerated Reader(tm) APP on the market?  The main complaints we have seen from other apps are that they do not have complete data and the developer does not support them.  Most apps will go out and do a search of Amazon or other book sites to find titles that are Accelerated Reader(tm) books.  The problem with this is that online book sellers are in the market to sell books, not keeping up with what one company is adding to their inventory every week.  Because of this, their book lists are usually outdated based on what Accelerated Reader(tm) currently has in it’s database.  We have direct access to the Accelerated Reader(tm) database and our application’s database is the most up to date you will find, including all of the Accelerated Reader(tm) books.   A lot of apps come from parents who want a convenience to finding Accelerated Reader(tm) books.  They are not APP developers nor do they have the time and resources to maintain their applications.  They are usually released with the disclaimers that the author may not update the software in the future. Our team of developers does this for a living.  From website design to app development, we have the resources to support our application and grow it in the future.  Why website designers?  The app is not a stand-alone product.  With the premium version you can download data for off-line viewing, however images and extensive data may not be available due to the storage requirements of the data.   Our website hosts all our images and provides additional resources that are not included in the app itself.  Some of the planned website features include:   Reviews of books as they become available  \n","List of newly released books  \n","Forums for parents and students to discuss the books they are reading  \n","\n","What about ARbookfind.com?   \n","Renaissance Learning(r) (the makers of Accelerated Reader(tm)) provides a web based tool to search for books in the Accelerated Reader(tm) catalog.  This tool is great if you are on a PC.  However, if you are in a library and browsing from your smart phone, it is not very smart phone friendly.  If you are browsing in an area where you do not have internet signal, you can’t get to their database at all.  Find for AR provides a simple to use, smart phone interface to the Accelerated Reader(tm) catalog.  When you do a search it will call down to our site to get the information and then present it in an easy to view format on your phone.  If you are out of internet range, you can still search (with the premium version) and get the book titles, AR points, Reading level, and Synopsis of the book from the internal database.  This database is updated weekly as AR updates their list.   Why invest in Find for AR?  While my company has been developing websites for over 15 years, we are still relatively new to the smart phone market.  We have developed a few apps for our customers, but taking on something that we need to maintain on a daily bases requires an investment.  The money we raise from this Kickstart project will go to cover the licenses and software fees that we need to pay out to get this project off the ground.  By investing in our project you will get the prizes associated with your pledge level (the levels that include a copy of the app will include the premium version of the app, not the ad supported version).  We believe that if a student is being rewarded for reading, they are going to want to read.  If they can’t find the books they are going to be rewarded for reading or if it is so difficult for them to access that information, they are going to lose interest.  By creating this app, we are giving students easy access to the data they need to make their reading decisions. \n","processed Description: ['find', 'reader', 'phone', 'app', 'software', 'program', 'middle', 'school', 'state', 'student', 'book', 'testing', 'student', 'book', 'writes', 'book', 'report', 'teacher', 'review', 'reader', 'student', 'quiz', 'book', 'thousand', 'book', 'reader', 'library', 'student', 'reading', 'student', 'book', 'interest', 'accurate', 'teacher', 'book', 'student', 'beginning', 'semester', 'student', 'amount', 'point', 'week', 'book', 'point', 'value', 'point', 'student', 'book', 'phone', 'application', 'student', 'parent', 'teacher', 'book', 'reader', 'name', 'book', 'user', 'information', 'information', 'amount', 'point', 'book', 'level', 'book', 'summary', 'book', 'picture', 'cover', 'version', 'book', 'version', 'app', 'limitation', 'book', 'search', 'title', 'author', 'number', 'version', 'app', 'functionality', 'advance', 'search', 'title', 'author', 'isbn', 'quiz', 'release', 'date', 'quiz', 'interest', 'level', 'atos', 'book', 'level', 'topic', 'subtopic', 'fiction', 'finction', 'filter', 'ability', 'bar', 'code', 'book', 'name', 'mark', 'book', 'offline', 'mode', 'ability', 'part', 'database', 'phone', 'information', 'line', 'star', 'rating', 'system', 'book', 'user', 'rate', 'book', 'advertisement', 'find', 'reader', 'app', 'market', 'complaint', 'apps', 'data', 'developer', 'apps', 'search', 'amazon', 'book', 'site', 'title', 'reader', 'book', 'problem', 'book', 'seller', 'market', 'book', 'company', 'inventory', 'week', 'book', 'list', 'reader', 'database', 'access', 'reader', 'database', 'application', 'database', 'date', 'reader', 'book', 'lot', 'parent', 'convenience', 'reader', 'book', 'developer', 'time', 'resource', 'application', 'disclaimer', 'author', 'software', 'future', 'team', 'developer', 'living', 'design', 'development', 'resource', 'application', 'future', 'website', 'app', 'product', 'version', 'data', 'line', 'image', 'data', 'storage', 'requirement', 'data', 'host', 'image', 'resource', 'app', 'website', 'feature', 'review', 'book', 'list', 'book', 'forum', 'parent', 'student', 'book', 'arbookfind', 'com', 'renaissance', 'maker', 'reader', 'web', 'tool', 'book', 'reader', 'catalog', 'tool', 'phone', 'phone', 'area', 'signal', 'database', 'phone', 'interface', 'reader', 'catalog', 'site', 'information', 'format', 'phone', 'internet', 'range', 'version', 'book', 'point', 'level', 'synopsis', 'book', 'database', 'database', 'list', 'invest', 'find', 'company', 'website', 'year', 'phone', 'market', 'apps', 'customer', 'something', 'base', 'investment', 'money', 'kickstart', 'project', 'license', 'software', 'fee', 'project', 'ground', 'project', 'prize', 'pledge', 'level', 'level', 'copy', 'app', 'version', 'app', 'version', 'student', 'book', 'reading', 'access', 'information', 'interest', 'app', 'student', 'access', 'data', 'reading', 'decision', '_', 'parent_teacher', 'release_date', 'star_rating', 'pledge_level', '_']\n","\n","\n","Document 207090:\n","[(8, 0.033678487), (9, 0.120931804), (15, 0.028353926), (16, 0.04672548), (18, 0.012301208), (33, 0.082625434), (35, 0.028227992), (39, 0.025256138), (40, 0.01889565), (41, 0.010154421), (44, 0.04539146), (46, 0.032027707), (49, 0.17611279), (55, 0.012237168), (58, 0.01403729), (60, 0.023013772), (62, 0.0155840395), (64, 0.029379675), (68, 0.013469682), (80, 0.032888442), (81, 0.04414766), (93, 0.035911918)]\n","Topic Probability: 0.17611278593540192\n","Project Description: When my daughter started kindergarten, I was introduced first hand to \"early reading\". Her teacher would send home little leveled books that we would reader together over and over again. Some weeks we were able to get in a lot of practice, but other weeks we barely looked at the books.As a teacher, I know how important it is to read with a child early and often, but the truth is sometimes we just don't have the time to sit down together. Now that my second daughter is getting ready for kindergarten, I have two little readers that need my attention. I was finding it impossible to read with both of them. They were constantly interrupting each other during our reading time to get help with their books.Plus, leveled books are only sold in school sets, and I didn't want to spend $200 to get 50 copies of level C books when my daughters would only be reading them for a few weeks. I searched the internet and finally found one app that had several leveled books for purchase. I was so excited! But this app only has 12 books per early reading level. I realized that I could make these books, and, with the help of my own little readers, create even more engaging content.Writing the books was easy and fun. What I struggled with was how to make them interactive. I wanted kids to be able to touch a word and hear it read to them. This way, when mom or dad is busy, they don't get stuck reading. After more intense research on the internet I found a program that allows me to add the interactivity to my books. While I can build the books for free, it will cost me $299 to publish my books so that other kids can enjoy them.\n","processed Description: ['daughter', 'kindergarten', 'hand', 'reading', 'teacher', 'home', 'book', 'week', 'lot', 'practice', 'week', 'book', 'teacher', 'truth', 'time', 'daughter', 'kindergarten', 'reader', 'attention', 'reading', 'time', 'help', 'book', 'book', 'school', 'set', 'copy', 'level', 'book', 'daughter', 'week', 'internet', 'app', 'book', 'purchase', 'book', 'reading', 'level', 'book', 'help', 'reader', 'content', 'book', 'kid', 'word', 'way', 'mom', 'dad', 'reading', 'research', 'internet', 'program', 'interactivity', 'book', 'book', 'book', 'kid', 'w', 'e', 'a', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', '_', 'f', 'o', 'r', 'e', 'c', 'a', 's', 't', 'book_book']\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["get_top_descriptions(df_lda_kickstarter_technology, 49, 10, lda_model)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":115,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["document_topic_distribution = lda_model.get_document_topics(corpus_technology)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Convert the TransformedCorpus object to a list of lists\n","document_topic_distribution_list = [list(doc) for doc in document_topic_distribution]\n","\n","# Print the structure of the document-topic distribution\n","for doc in document_topic_distribution_list:\n","    print(doc)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":127,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[('earth', 0.07328849), ('space', 0.05889715), ('planet', 0.05794305), ('mission', 0.053534202), ('rocket', 0.042700317), ('experiment', 0.030173728), ('launch', 0.029435897), ('exploration', 0.028161496), ('science', 0.026005017), ('moon', 0.025583562)]\n","Document 1 (Corpus ID 5260):\n","Topic Probability: 0.22032104\n","Document Text: [9, 30, 38, 48, 64, 83, 84, 101, 113, 115, 119, 128, 133, 138, 139, 172, 173, 182, 206, 263, 319, 329, 332, 335, 354, 366, 391, 411, 429, 450, 453, 472, 488, 490, 503, 518, 524, 526, 532, 596, 605, 618, 645, 669, 897, 921, 928, 1132, 1159, 1198, 1224, 1354, 1410, 1416, 1542, 1567, 1683, 2506, 2508, 3145, 3148, 3229, 3596, 3609, 3634, 4416, 4686, 4893, 5836, 6580, 8128, 12231]\n","Project Description:                                            booksplatform.comBooks platform uses the same concept of buying selling and renting the books but with some little modification. In this platform we will help student’s rent and sell their books to other students by connecting them with each other with this platform. We are not serving as a retailer and we will not buy sell and rent any books, we will just help students by providing this platform. Students will chose the books and their prices, and for that we will also provide the price compare feature so that a student can chose the best price for books. Now the question is  how does this platform works, it is so simple you just sign up, select the text books that you have and want to rent and sell, select the price, and you are done. Now when someone orders your book you just pack the book, print a prepaid slip from the website, stick it and mail it. Whoever rent or buy your books you will get the money and by renting you will get your books back after some time and you will be ready to rent these books again. Thanks for backing this project and see the rewards section for reward details. It is a platform that provide website features to all the students to buy, sell or rent their books notes or any other college material to other college students.After buying the books and using it only one time or only for one semester students have only two options either keep the books at home on a bookshelf to collect dust or either sell it to a major retailers for the cast of pennies.One day I though how can I still keep all of my books that I have and also can make some money out of these books, with that thought in my mind I tried to rent my text books to my other class mates and it worked so I made a little money and I still have these books.On that day I came up with the idea to provide individual students a platform to either buy, sell or rent their books to other students and make money out of the books. So I launched the website www.booksplatform.com\n","Original theme of the site                 Story behind booksplatformOne day I was sitting in my room, and looking at the bookshelf which is full of text books and started thinking what should I do with these books. I thought how can I still keep all of these books and can also make some money out of these books, with that thought in my mind, one day I decided to rent the books as an individual college student to other individual college students. When I rented the books I told the guys if you return the books to me at the end of the semester I will give you half the money back that you paid me. When the semester ended the guy contacted me and returned the books to me by that way I made a little money and I still have the books. So I decided rather than renting the books from other retailers student should rent books to each other. By this way students can make a little money from all the books that they have at home.Work in process theme                 How dose booksplatform.com works?Sign Up and you are ready to use it.You choose the books and the selling or renting price for those books.This website is a solid platform with all the features to connect individual students with each other to buy, sell or rent their books.This website is completely free and independent of any retailers.We do not buy, sell or rent any books or college material, we just provide a platform to connect students.

The Nandi Bear has evolved and adapted to the 21st century.  He now thoroughly enjoys tracking books and even has his own website! NandiBear.com is a remarkable and exceptional place and where humans and Nandi Bears work together with the following objectives:  •    Track books as they travel the planet (see where they've been!)           •    Keep the Nandi Bear informed and up-to-date.  He likes to know where his books are presently located!  •    Read book reviews written by members of the Nandi Bear community!  •    Write book reviews, let the Nandi Bear know what you think about your book.  •    Rate books using the Nandi Bear's 10 star system. What is the 10 star system?  We believe that 10 stars (as opposed to 5 stars) help readers to effectively and accurately rate books that they've read. With time we believe that book lovers will flock to our website to read our accurate reviews when considering whether or not to purchase or read a book. Why? It's our position that the 5 star system book rating system, found elsewhere, may be mathematical accurate but is not aesthetically accurate. For example, 7 stars (out of 10) emanates more effectively than 3.5 stars (out of 5).  How do you track books? At our website (NandiBear.com) you will be able to apply for a Nandi Bear Passport for your book (any book, you don't have to be the author). You'll need information such as the book's title, edition, printing, current location of book (e.g., city, state and country) and a scan of the cover of your copy of the book. Why do we ask for a scan of the book cover? A book cover is a memory, it's as much a part of the book as is the content between the covers. In the publishing world book covers are updated and sometimes swapped out for wholly new designs. When a reader spots a particular cover that they remember they experience a pleasant and fulfilling connection with the book. You'll also need a printer, a sheet of adhesive printer paper and something to cut with (scissors or some sort of paper trimmer). Here is our very first Nandi Bear Passport being trimmed and affixed to the inside cover of one of the books in our personal library:                                 Each passport sticker will bear a unique Nandi Bear Passport Number. At the website (NandiBear.com) you'll enter the current location of the book (city, state and country) and as much other relevant data as you would like. If you ever sell, donate or lose your book you can also add this information to the book's online passport. When the new owner of the book opens the cover and sees the Nandi Bear Passport sticker they too are directed to our website (NandiBear.com) and can add the new location of the book. They can also record where they found/bought the book at or how they came to possess the book. As a book travels the planet, from owner to owner, or old location to new location (same owner), NandiBear.com will keeping a record of their passport for all of us to see! Readers can also post reviews of the books that they see being tracked at NandiBear website. Our website is up but we need your help ($$$) to build the book tracking application and our database. What you currently see at frontend of the NandiBear.com website is, at very best (if you grant us a little latitude and are in a generous mood!), our minimum viable product. We'd also like to develop the site so that readers can upload PDFs of hard to find books and booklets which are both no longer under copyright and not yet found online. We own these sorts of old books and booklets and in the past we've experimented with uploading them to sites such as Srcibd. We've also encountered problems at Scribd and found that uploads were sometimes replaced, by Scribd, with other versions that were later found elsewhere online. We've also had uploads removed by Scribd. The NandiBear needs your help developing NandiBear.com! All pledges will be applied to: - Developing the book tracking application - Building a database - Developing a Scribd-like document upload addition to the site. We hope that Darwin Studios in Atlanta, Georgia will be a component of this project.

Coins are gained by sending out books and are used to buy books from others. The shipping is always paid by the requester and a prepaid shipping label is sent to the sender.  \t\t\t\t\t\t   Exclusive BookCoin shirt design!      Our Vision:  \t\t\t\t\t\tWe have a vision to make trading books simple for everyone. We wanted to create something that we would use; something that makes it easy to find new books that have been on our wish list and get rid of old books that have been well loved. Books should never be thrown out when others can continue to enjoy their stories for many more years.  \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the money used for?  \t\t\t\t\t\tWe are asking for your help in funding the website and app. The money donated will be used for creating and maintaining the site and app. It will also go towards purchasing books for the site. We want to make sure there is a selection of good books that people want to read. Everyone has a different preference of what they like to read, so we want to have all types of books available from the start, whether they be fiction, nonfiction, poetry, history, educational, religious, children’s books, etc!  \t\t\t\t\t\tThough we have experience in programming on web and app platforms, some of the funds will be used to recruit others to help build the site. The goal is to have BookCoin available on the web, for iOS in beta form by early 2015, with an Android app to follow.  \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the \"coin\" system?  \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tThe strength of BookCoin lies in the coin system. Each coin is worth one book; you get a coin for sending a book and use a coin to get a new book. Coins never expire, and books on the catalogue are available on a first come first serve basis, meaning no waiting lists! The coin system promotes a catalogue of quality books. One has the incentive to post books others want because they receive a coin for only the books they send out. Don’t see a book you want right now? Don’t worry: the catalogue is always changing and expanding.  \t\t\t\t\t\tThe coin system is unique to any other trading site and provides lots of benefits. Trading using a coin system allows for a large catalogue of books to chose from and provides a safe, fair environment. Shipping is always paid by the requester of the book, and a shipping label is emailed to the sender. Because one cannot purchase more books then they have coins, it ensures that users will spend their coins wisely and also be encouraged to list quality books.  \t\t\t\t\t\tOnce a user requests a book, his coin is put into a waiting system. The coin is then transferred to the sender once the book is shipped and marked “received” or after a reasonable time after being shipped.  \t\t\t\t\t\tIs it free and secure?  \t\t\t\t\t\tThis website is free to join and all your information will be kept safe and secure! We will never give out any of your information without your consent.  \t\t\t\t\t\tIs BookCoin expandable?  \t\t\t\t\t\tBookCoin will provide an expandable base for a large group of users. The more users there are, the more books that are listed and the better opportunity to find exactly what you are looking for.

This is where BookCoin comes in! \t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is our vision for BookCoin in the future?  \t\t\t\t\t\tOur vision for the future of BookCoin is to see a great site and app expand into something book lovers use and adore. Our hope is that a successful site and app will allow us to give more coins to dedicated users as we personally upload more books to the catalogue. We may also introduce a BookCoin market for T-Shirts, bookmarks, and notebooks on the website! \n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["chosen_topic = 49\n","\n","print(lda_model.show_topic(chosen_topic,
