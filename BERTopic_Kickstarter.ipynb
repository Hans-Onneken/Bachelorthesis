Movyabox is a self-contained, portable streaming media server which allows users to easily load, take and stream their media collections (including both music and video content) at home or on the move. Simply put, a media server is a device that stores and shares media content of multiple types. Movyabox allows the user to play their content on up to six devices regardless of the operating platform of the device (smartphone, tablet, PC or Mac).         While at their homes, users can connect Movyabox to their TV, allowing them to watch streamed content from such sites as Netflix, HBO, and others, but also from content that has been downloaded to the device.         Movyabox at Home         You\\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

With this behind us, we are now close to entering production of the Movyabox. If our Kickstarter venture is successful, we will continue to improve the technology with our designers and manufacturer.                 Movyabox is built using open source hardware and software that we strongly believe in. We committed our prototype and first production run to an open source system. Below are some of the open sources and standard technologies we use:         Because we\\'ve been supported by such a great open source community we will donate, if funded, \\xa0a percentage of our raise to 3 of our open source partners that helped us make our dream a reality; Raspberry PI, Openelec, and Kodi (formerly XMBC).\\xa0 We believe in paying it forward to foster innovation and betterment of our operating world just as they do.  \\r\\nSo What Was The Spark Behind The Idea?   In my previous career, I traveled extensively for my job (around 600,000 miles in the last four years). Additionally, my family typically takes several 10+ hour road trips each year. Traveling like this brings boredom, prompting the typical question of “are we there yet?” Ugh! Thus, I was always looking for ways to keep myself and my family entertained.  First, I purchased an entertainment center for my minivan. The cost was excessive, but it kept my kids occupied for hours. However, at a certain point, one kid is tired of watching My Little Pony while the other is too young to watch anything too scary. Next, I broke down and purchased iPads for the kids, but the real horror began when I realized that one of the iPads was 45.1MB overcapacity when I was trying to load content for my daughter.           Panic set in. How is it that this iPad is over capacity? What should I delete from my daughter’s iPad since she feels strongly she needs everything on the device?   \"Are you really using Covet Fashion\", I asked.     \"Duh, Dad, of course.\"   \"Can I delete some of these 50 photos of our dog?\"   \"No, Dad, I need them all.\"   After several events like this, I started thinking of a solution.  I wanted a device that didn’t take up additional hard drive space on the iPads, my Samsung Note or my wife’s Kindle Fire. The dream device would need to be able to stream media content to multiple devices while on-the-go without consuming precious mobile bandwidth. Surely there had to be a device I could find that would do the job fairly well, but would also be easy to use. It would need to be similar to a media server, but portable.  Unfortunately, after much research and time invested, I realized that this device did not exist. There were various devices that did individual parts of what I needed, such as wireless media drives or an Apple TV, but no device provided the comprehensive, ultimate solution to my entertainment needs.    And the concept of Movyabox was born!   Movyabox is a portable media server that can be used on the road and in the home. Why Choose Movyabox? No Conversion Is Necessary \\xa0\\xa0 Unlike other wireless media drives, the Movyabox will convert video into a format that any device can consume. Maybe you have a file in AVI format that you want to view from your iPad. No problem. Just load the content onto the Movyabox and start watching. Movyabox does the conversion work for you! \\xa0 Take Third Party Content With You  \\xa0 Have you ever experienced the despair of choosing your movie DVDs carefully to take on a trip only to find out that the movie you were looking forward to is missing from the case? Bummer. Movyabox solves this problem for you.\\xa0 As an added bonus, with a 3rd party add-on which we will included with the premier edition and higher, our product allows the user to record and download content from mainstream providers such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video and many other media properties.\\xa0Please note that the user must have a Windows PC to access the full functionality of recording from the web. \\xa0 Internet Access Not Required   No internet access? Again, no problem! Movyabox was built for access without internet connection. No need to use those expensive data plans to stream content. Our device is small enough to fit into your pocket and allows you to bring downloaded content from the web. When you arrive back home, our device will easily connect to sync more content or to stream.\\xa0 Easy To Use          You\\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.       Play                                   Replay with sound          Play with \\r\\n sound             00:00   00:00                                       Movyabox is a simple-to-use portable media server that will take sharing your media content to the next level. We took the best of open source hardware and software and tweaked it to deliver the best portable media device you will ever use. Not only does it function for the user as a media server, you can plug in a HDMI cord and use it at home. \\xa0 It is like having Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV or Google Chromecast bundled with a SanDisk wireless media drive. It is also easy to add additional storage via the available USB ports on the back of Movyabox. Taking a long road trip with friends? Not only can you easily share your media content, but your friends can also plug their USB device into Movyabox and share their content as well (please remember to be respectful of copyright infringement rules).\\xa0 So What Features Does Movyabox Have?  Play just about any HD or SD video through its standard HDMI connection, as well as all music files\\xa0 Add media content easily through the device by just dragging and dropping the files from your PC or USB flash drive\\xa0 Comes with a custom remote in the Premiere Plus Edition (or can be purchased separately for other models) Can be controlled through a web browser from any iOS, Android or laptop (Mac or PC) using our free Remote app.\\xa0 Built using open source technology, which in general just makes the world work better!\\xa0 Four USB ports (three free slots available for adding additional USB devices or flash drives)\\xa0 A rechargeable battery for superior portability\\xa0 Wireless streaming WITHOUT need for your own mobile hotspot, Wi-Fi network or data bandwidth\\xa0 Supports simultaneous content streaming for up to six devices independently\\xa0 Open and Customizable\\xa0 Crafted with love A portion of proceeds will be donated in support of Raspberry PI and Kodi/Open Elec in recognition of their support to the open source community and our cause\\xa0   So How is Movyabox Packaged?\\xa0 A Green Packaging Solution!    A \"clear\" day in Southern Chinese City      After traveling to China to view the manufacturing site, we realized just how horrible the pollution is there.\\xa0 We’ve committed ourselves to finding solutions to help reduce waste and pollution without increasing cost.\\xa0 Each year consumers throw away millions of pounds of paper and cardboard.\\xa0 Ultimately, the consumption of these paper products impacts our environment.\\xa0 Very conscientiously, our team came up with a nifty, “green” solution to ship our product to our project backers. We\\'ve worked with a company which makes an organizing system that keeps items stored in a neat and tidy way. This\\xa0eco-friendly cord organizer will not only be used to ship the device but also provide attractive carrying case for the Movyabox. \\xa0\\xa0 Each product will be shipped securely in our eco-friendly cord organizer, which will ultimately reduce the amount of post-consumer waste.\\xa0 Obviously, we will have to ship the entire product, enveloped in a eco-friendly cord organizer, to the consumer in a cardboard box on the exterior.\\xa0 On the interior, we will secure with a limited amount of eco-friendly packing, and please don\\'t forget to recycle.\\xa0  The Team for Movyabox Our team is made up of entrepreneurs, product managers, business developement, ninja designers, marketers, and software developers. From a manufacturing\\xa0perspective, we spent time in Hong Kong and China visiting\\xa0with many manufacturers to find the ideal partner to address our concerns about the environment. \\xa0        You\\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

We will make the devices “prettier” (yes, we are tech geeks and may need your suggestions), and streamline our materials sourcing and manufacturing process to deliver more quickly the next time around. After that, we will get to work tightening up some of the partnerships we envision with content providers to keep making your Movyabox experience better and better. The final piece of help we need; your ideas and encouragement.\\xa0 We’ve brought products to life before, but every venture is new and a bit like an exploration.\\xa0 Movyabox is testing our creativity and problem-solving skills in new, challenging, and fun ways.\\xa0 We know just how sharp the Kickstarter community is and would be grateful if you call our attention to things on which we can improve upon. \\xa0 Rewards Summary         \\xa0Last but not least. . .  In doing anything in life, its all about the support you get from family, friends, and even strangers. \\xa0We would like to thank:  Noel would like to thank his wife, Kristie. Without Kristie’s help and encouragement, we probably would have had to illustrate our video with stick figures or finger puppets. Kristie put in a stellar performance and allowed us to poke a little fun at her frustration with technology. By the way, she does know how to use her iPhone. He would also like to thank his two daughters for playing a part in their little theatrical production. A thank you to Bryan Brazil, who graciously allows us to show and use his Kodi skin on our prototype.Though we just met Bryan, he is just like many people we meet in the open source community that will always lend a hand to help.

It made a most beautiful cameo in this video.\\xa0          Geoff is a seasoned watch enthusiast, world traveler and a captain piloting B787’s for Air Canada. He has been testing one of the four V7 prototypes in existence for a month. He sent me a picture from the flight deck and his travels, and posted a review on WatchUSeek. Click on this link to see what he had to say: \\xa0Geoff\\'s WatchUSeek Review          Karl is a true early adaptor, but not one of those who talks about it. So I will do it for him. He was the 4th to contribute to our EQ campaign and he bought the first WorldWatch V7 prototype off my hands just a couple of weeks ago. It arrived in Germany 2 days ago and this is what he had to say: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hey Björn, My World Watch has arrived. I am really so impressed... the blue hand and silver case, the colors of the display- definitely the most beautiful watch you have ever made! Also love the ratcheted bezel ring, moveable in 12-minute steps. Of course I noticed that the serial number on the back plate is actually ONE. How cool is that? I feel very honored!\\xa0 The WW is really such a big step forward, though it is essentially the EQ combined with advantages of the older versions. The solar and lunar rings, also the moon not visibly divided into segments- looks better, day/night division of the whole watch face. There are so many little things: the light stays on just a little bit longer, the alarm sound seems just a little bit louder, the buttons will not be activated involuntarily and most importantly: the hand is now thinner and the digits bigger, so the hand will no more interfere with readability. 13:00? 13:06? 13:08? I would say this watch is really your masterpiece... the EQ case looks clumsy, but this one just smooth and cool, however thick it is. Finally I found the watch I had dreamed of... and it did NOT cost 20,000 as expected. Thank you so much! \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Karl, Doctor of Medicine. Here is a link to Karls posting in a German forum: Karl\\'s Post \\r\\n Perfection is an endless pursuit.          “Are you stark raving crazy? Getting into the watch manufacturing business? Don’t you know that manufacturing is just one endless headache?” \\xa0I can still vividly hear the questions that Harry asked when he first heard I was getting into the watch business. Way, way back. He was the CFO of the Sundance Catalog company and had seen more than his share of product manufacturing and delivery challenges. He knew.\\xa0 Yet here we are, 20 years later and I finally feel like a graduate. Our wings have been thoroughly clipped and pruned, but we’re still flying. Harry was right in too many ways to even start thinking about, but giving up was never an option. We learned a lot from our last development, crowdfunding and manufacture of the Equilibrium. Everything we gathered from that mind bending undertaking has been changed and added in the new WorldWatch V7.\\xa0 The Equilibrium is basically sold out, we have just a handful of them left. They will not be put into manufacture again. Such is the reality of seeking perfection. Only 500 were made, if you have one, you have a rarity. We will of course continue to service them. Below is a comparison between the Equilibrium and the new WorldWatch, showing the brand new features and designs of the V7.                                  The WorldWatch V7 case and LCD screen has been re-engineered and re-tooled from scratch to include the NEW features shown. It is ready for mass production.                  We also did a number of minor programming refinements that will be noticed by only the keenest of watch aficionados. Here are the highlights of that effort:    Tighter calculations of twilight giving \\xa0greater accuracy, especially at higher latitudes.   Continuous running of hand during TIMER, STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN/UP functions.   2 times more power fed to analog hand for greater accuracy.   Elimination of the REGATTA ALARM.   SET RING now also allows for the entire ARC display to show times for only \\xa0\\xa0sunrise and sunset.           Introducing the new YES WorldWatch V7, Nature\\'s Time Keeper.\\xa0          Have you ever wondered when the sun will rise? Or what the moon is doing tonight? What time it might be in some faraway place? Or when to catch the golden light? When the night is at its darkest for stargazing? Perhaps embarking on a traveling adventure and need a time companion that truly knows local time? Show you when the perfect time to escape is?\\xa0Or simply curious about the subtle nuances of time all around you? The WorldWatch V7 offers an awareness, mindfulness and understanding of time that will bring added dimensions to your timing no matter what you are about to do.\\xa0          \\r\\n \\r\\n The cycles of time, the fabric of our lives.\\xa0 Time and space are so many things. Events and memories.\\xa0Past, present and future. When it comes to the art and science of time keeping there are basically three fundamental cycles we have counted since the dawn of existence:    First. The daily spinning of the earth. Day and night, 24 hours.\\xa0   Second. The lunar cycle. 29.53 days from each full moon to the next.   Third. The solar year, 365.24 days before it starts again.  The challenge our forefathers of time kept running into was that these 3 cycles don\\'t neatly divide into each other. They all spin to their own tune. Follow one and the other two eventually goes out of sync. It was a massive undertaking to create an accurate calendar and time keeping system that stayed in sync with all these 3 cycles. For agriculture, for prayer, for life, \\xa0for community. Many moons ago I had lunch with an engineer from Glashutte at the Basel Messe. I had envisioned a mechanical marvel for my watch idea and needed to learn more. After talking for a while he just smiled and told me that if I wanted to do all this in a mechanical watch, I would be carrying a backpack. We laughed and had another beer but it does illustrate the challenge astronomers, clock builders and watch makers have faced throughout history. The astronomical algorithms used to calculate these 3 cycles are just way too complicated for any mechanical or quartz movement to capture and interpret. John Harrison and Nevil Maskelyne simply could not combine their strengths into one time piece. Technology at their time barred any such attempt. Now we can. Not until chip technology became available did it become possible to harness the insights and subtle nuances of all these 3 cycles on that little spot on your wrist. The YES watches do exactly that, and the new WorldWatch does it better than ever. To the minute, for wherever you are. It is by far the best timekeeper we have put together. Like an electronic sundial on your wrist. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"Now we need your help to get the WorldWatch V7 manufacturing funded. We have 4 prototypes here, fully operational, developed and ready for production. We\\'re looking to make 1000 of them out the gate and to that end we are offering some great early bird specials.

You see, I programmed all the lights onstage. I set the light scenes and moods you see when you go to see a play or a concert. It\\'s a complicated process because you have to speak the lights language. And like all languages, if you don\\'t speak it well the meaning gets lost and things can go wrong very quickly. Which is what happened on the day I had my idea.   Lighting Load-In at The Wortham Theater - Houston, Texas      The target customers for The DMX Chart are all lighting designers, light board programmers, theatrical lighting crews, Broadway lighting crews, touring musical lighting crews, touring concert lighting crews, Church lighting crews, AV companies, Event companies, and any company that has stage lighting. This includes all technical lighting schools for stage and theater. The key attribute here is the professional English speaking lighting industry. DMX stands for digital multiplexing. It is the language used by a lighting console to talk to the lighting instruments on a stage. Basically, anything that has a plug can be controlled by a lighting console.  For over thirty years the lighting industry has been using offline spreadsheets to keep track of all this DMX data. They literally carry onstage a 3 ring binder, about 6 inches thick that contains all the printouts from their offline spreadsheets.  Having to keep the entire crew updated on the fast paced changes that lighting techs make to the lighting rig, becomes a huge challenge. Copies of the lighting rigs DMX data are carried by technicians when they are working on the lighting rig. They pencil in the data that has changed on the copy, and then give it back to the keeper of the bible that holds all DMX data sheets from the offline spreadsheet. All DMX data have Universes. There are 512 DMX data blocks to one universe, and you can have infinite universes. DMX data is real picky about not assigning multiple DMX data to the  same block of data in a universe. So the problem that lighting consoles have is figuring out where in a universe they can assign a DMX block of data to a lighting fixture so the light knows if it is in blocks 1 thru 15 of a DMX universe, to pay attention to what the console says to it, and all the other lights will not pay attention.  Stage lighting crews literally will address the intelligent lighting fixtures with a starting DMX address. For instance if a moving light fixture uses 15 parameters of DMX data, and the light board programmer wanted to assign it to universe 1 with DMX data blocks of 11-25, then the stage lighting technicians would physically address that lighting fixture with a starting address of 11. This means that every time the lighting console transmits DMX data over the DMX data blocks 11-25, only that specific moving light fixture would pay attention to it. This is where human error comes into the picture.Because the DMX data is calculated by humans, they sometimes get overlapped, and the error generally doesn\\'t get noticed until the Light Board Programmer actually sits down to enter the DMX data into the console which in lighting terms means the patch. The lighting console will always catch the error, and by this time the crew has already addressed all the lighting fixtures, so correcting the overlap means that the stage lighting crew has to go back and physically re-address each lighting fixture. This can sometimes take many hours. \\xa0I wanted to make the language easy to understand for the lighting gear, and the people who have to use it. I wanted to make it as simple as possible eliminating any human error in the process. I wanted it to be in a cloud so all that needed the data could have immediate access to it! No mistakes, No worries! No melt downs! :)I hired a brilliant database programmer in 2013, and the first prototype was born in 2014. I called it The DMX Chart, and it is registered with the United States Trademark and Patent Office as a Software as a Service. It has its own serial number!\\xa0The DMX Chart has powerful error checking capabilities that eliminate the human error factors. The DMX Chart is a massive online database and spreadsheet program that was built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. It is on a dedicated server, with a dedicated IP address. The entire website has an EV SSL Certificate to protect the clients data. The DMX Chart Version 1 was tracking all DMX values for every lighting fixture that was on stage. It was correcting the human error. It was cataloging every detail. But it was only tracking the DMX values of everything that was controlled by DMX data, like a moving light fixture.\\xa0   A Moving Light - VariLite VL3500      It wasn\\'t tracking the DMX data of the things on stage that just had a plug, like a par can,\\xa0   A Par Can - A Conventional Light      or things like a single normal light bulb. These things are called conventional lights, and it means that you can only control one value of that light or fixture, for example the intensity. Think of it like this,\\xa0if you flip a light switch in your house,        the intensity of the light is either on or off. You can\\'t control anything else.\\xa0I wanted to track these normal DMX values that a normal light bulb has along with the fixtures that were controlled by DMX data.\\xa0\\xa0So my programmer and I went back to work.From 2014 to early 2015 and several versions later, The DMX Chart version 4 was born. It was now tracking everything that had a plug and was controlled by a lighting console. I knew there was nothing else on the market like this software, and I had many other ideas that would sell this to the professional lighting industry. I released Version 4 to the public and started advertising on Facebook. I knew it was just a matter of advertising to get the word out. But unfortunately, I got just a few nibbles.\\xa0   Just released Version 4 - Facebook Ad      I knew this was going to work. I felt it in my heart. I still feel it in my heart! I knew I was close to a polished product. I made the decision to pull my 401K out to fund my project, quit my job, and spend my time completely focusing on The DMX Chart. From 2014 to 2015, I designed many other things into the software. Everything in the lighting world that was needed to maintain a show was in the program.\\xa0 Three different spreadsheets which includes an interactive channel check\\xa0 The Fixture Type Schedule   The Fixture Type Schedule - Spreadsheet      The Fixture Type Schedule is a spreadsheet of BOTH your DMX Controlled Fixture Types and your Conventional Fixture Types listed by position for all show names within your current chart. \\xa0The DMX Controlled Fixture Types Spreadsheet   The DMX Controlled Fixture Type Spreadsheet      The DMX Controlled Fixture Types spreadsheet is a place for you to keep track of just your DMX controlled fixture types for all show names within your current chart. \\xa0The Interactive Channel Check   The Interactive Channel Check - Spreadsheet      The Channel Check spreadsheet is simply used for your channel checks, listing each show name individually with the channel numbers from lowest to highest.\\xa0Interactive work notes   Interactive Work Notes!      \\xa0The Work Notes consists of two parts. general work notes, and work notes generated from the interactive channel check. The general work notes offers a place to keep track of your daily changes that are made, or from tech rehearsal\\'s notes. There\\'s a place to enter the channel, dimmer, and position, along with a text box so you can decribe the work note in detail. Once you have entered a work note it will begin the list. For each row in the list there is a strike thru button which is a way for you to indicated the problem was fixed, and a delete button which will delete the note off the list. \\xa0The Channel Check Work Notes is the list of channels that have problems when you encountered them running the Interactive Channel Check. For each row in the list there is a strike thru button which is a way for you to indicated the problem was fixed, and a delete button which will delete the note off the list.   When you click on the Report Problem button on the Channel Check Controls when running an interactive channel check, The DMX Chart throws that channels data into the Channel Check Work Notes. Here you will find the channel\\'s data you are having problems with. There are check boxes for focus problems, and for burn outs, there is also a text box if you need to give more detail. Once you click on the save button in the Work Notes Tab, The DMX Chart will take you right back to the channel check and the last channel that you were on when you encountered the problem, and you can continue on with the interactive channel check.\\xa0A complete color coded visual of every block of DMX data that is allocated in every universe that has DMX data   The DMX Used Tab - DMX Controlled Fixture Types - Replugs      \\xa0All DMX controlled fixture types in The DMX Used Tab are shaded in blue. By mousing over the DMX controlled fixture types blocks of DMX data that are used in the each universe, The DMX Chart will tell you: If it\\'s a conventional or DMX controlled fixture type, what show name or show names it belongs to, where it is located in your lighting rig by position, the dimmer specs, what the fixture type actually is, the DMX address, the absolute DMX address, and the unit number. \\xa0     DMX Used Tab - Conventional Fixture Types - Replugs      All Conventional fixture types in The DMX Used Tab are shaded in pink. For each conventional block of data, The DMX Chart will tell you: If it\\'s a conventional or DMX controlled fixture type, what show name or show names it belongs to, where it is located in your lighting rig by position,what type of fixture it actually is, the DMX address, the absolute DMX address, the unit number, its purpose in life, and the dimmer specs. \\xa0 Six libraries The Conventional Gobo Library   The Conventional Gobo Library      \\xa0   Conventional Gobo Library      The Conventional Gobo Library keeps track of your conventional gobos that you have used and are using.  When you are entering in conventional fixture types in the Conventional Fixture Types data box on The Input Tab, and you need to document that a specific conventional fixture type has a gobo in it. You can do so by selecting a conventional gobo from the Conventional Gobo drop down menu. The DMX Chart has a few listed as defaults that you can either keep there or delete them.\\xa0The Conventional Color Library   The Conventional Color Library      \\xa0The Conventional Color Library has default gel colors from four manufactures, and all new color you add to this library using the Gel Color Options Tab located on your list of Tabs which is you navagation bar. When you mouse over a gel color in the Conventional Color Library, The DMX Chart will display a tool tip that will give you the full name of the color, RGB values in range of 0-255, the RGB percent values, the CMY values in range of 0-255, and the CMY percent values.\\xa0The Fixture Type Parameters Library   The Fixture Type Parameters Library         Displays the paramaters of a fixture!      \\xa0The DMX Controlled Fixture Type Parameters Library keeps track of each parameter that is used by your DMX Controlled fixture types. You can edit, or delete each parameter for the DMX controlled fixture type you select, and there is a notes section at the bottom of the parameters list if you need to add any kind of documention to your fixture type. It\\'s very useful when your trying to trouble shoot a fixture type. You won\\'t have to google manuals anymore! \\xa0The Custom Scroll Library   The Custom Scroll Library      The Custom Scroll Library keeps track of your frame data for your custom scroll strings. You can edit, or delete each frame for the custom scroll string you select, and there is a notes section at the bottom of the frame list if you need to add any kind of documention to your custom scroll string. It\\'s very useful when your trying to trouble shoot a scroll string you think might have the wrong colors in it!\\xa0The Library of Custom Gobo\\'s for Moving Lights   Library of Custom Gobo\\'s for Moving Lights      The Library of Custom Gobos for Moving Lights keeps track of all your custom gobos in your moving lights.  When you are entering in moving lights in the DMX Controlled Fixture Types data box on The Input Tab, and you need to document that a specific mover has a custom gobo in it. You can do so by selecting the Custom Gobos for Moving Lights drop down menu. If you have never documented the custom gobo before, you can select the Add New button from the Custom Gobos for Moving Lights drop down menu. \\xa0The Library of Moving Light Wheels   The Library of Moving Light Wheels      The Library of Moving Light Wheels is a library that will keep track of your rotating, static, and color wheels. The Library comes with a few defaults. If you wish to keep track of your moving light wheels you will have to define them here. Once they are defined The DMX Chart will remember them for every chart your company creates there after.  For every moving light that you add to the DMX Controlled Fixture Type drop down menu on the Input Tab, and designate it a moving light, The DMX Chart will also add it to the list here. This library is here for your reference only. Adding to it does not effect anything else in The DMX Chart, or how The DMX Chart functions.\\xa0Que sheets for Lighting Ques, Spotlight Ques, and Deck Electrician QuesThe Lighting Que Sheets   Lighting Que Sheets      \\xa0The Lighting Que Sheet is a list of your Electrics que\\'s for each show name in your chart. You can add to, delete from and edit this list here.\\xa0The Spotlight Que Sheets   Spotlight Que Sheets      \\xa0The Spotlight Que Sheet is a list of your spotlight que\\'s for each show name in your chart. Here it lists the Electrics que number next to the Spotlight que number. Entering the electrics que number is optional. It\\'s there as a reference. You can add to, delete from and edit this list. Each spotlight number in the que sheet has it\\'s own column of que\\'s which are highlighted in its own highlight color in which you can set when you add new spotlights to your show. The gel frame color for each spotlight is listed next to the spotlight number, and the cross hair next to the spotlight gel color frames is way for you to move the entire spotlight numbers column. For example, if you are spotlight number three and you wanted your que list next to the actual spotlight que numbers, because it\\'s easier to read that way, simply click on the cross hair and drag it there.\\xa0Deck Electrician Que Sheets   Deck Electrician Que Sheets      \\xa0The Deck Electricians Que Sheet is a list of your Deck Electrics que\\'s for each show name in your chart. Here it lists the Electrics que number next to the Deck Electricians que number. Entering the electrics que number is optional. It\\'s there as a reference. You can add to, delete from and edit this list here. \\xa0 Focus charts Focus Charts!   Focus Charts!      \\xa0When you enter fixture types into The Input Tab, The DMX Chart will also start a list by show, of the position and unit number in The Focus Charts Tab, which is located in the list of tabs, which is your navagation bar. Simply click the edit button for the positions unit number, and enter into the text box the focus description.\\xa0 Vendor contact lists\\xa0 The Vendor/Rental Gear Tab is a place to keep track of your Vendor contact information, and all your rental gear, including the invoices.\\xa0Vendor Contact Lists   Vendor Contact Lists!      \\xa0\\xa0 Rental gear lists Rental Gear Lists   Rental Gear Lists      \\xa0 Over 60 YouTube help videos \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 Three manuals and a workbook  was all in a cloud, and everything could be accessed by the entire stage crew. \\xa0You can actually assign different types of accounts to the crew which would allow them editing privileges or not. The accounts are Administrative, which gives full editing abilities. Crew level accounts that can only view the data, and Spotlight level accounts which allows your spotlight operators editing capabilities only in the Spotlight Que Sheet, they can only view everything else.The feedback I got back from lighting designers on Facebook was that it would not be useful to them unless it talked to a CAD program (Computer Aided Drafting) called Vectorworks Spotlight which is manufactured by the Nemetschek Company. \\xa0When a lighting designer designs where to put lights on a stage, they typically use this CAD program. In Vectorworks Spotlight they are able to define all parts of a fixture. This process is extremely detailed. I can understand why they wouldn\\'t want to enter the same data again - into my software program.\\xa0   CAD Lighting program -Vectorworks Spotlight      With the last few dollars I had to my name for this project, I went back to the drawing board to invent the current version 4.1 which now talks to Vectorworks Spotlight. The DMX Chart is now importing Vectorworks Spotlight instrument data, but my advertising dollars no longer exist.\\xa0And there\\'s more that people want from this software. I kept getting requests from around the world that usually started with \"If your software could do this ...I would be more interested in subscribing to your service.\" \\xa0For the last 6 months I have been making a list of the major things that everyone could benefit from.\\xa0 A Maintenance Tab - This would keep track of all the fixture types maintenance needs from lamp changes, lamp hours, cable insulation inspections, lens and reflector last cleaned dates, electrical parts inpections, mechanical parts inspections, optics checks, and fully bench tested dates of every fixture type in the entire lighting rig.\\xa0 A Label Maker - that would print standard 5160 Avery labels. \\xa0From a list of fields residing in the database. You will get to choose what type of data you want to print on the labels. These labels are used on cables going to the lighting fixture, on the fixtures themselves to identify DMX addressing and Universe selections, and just about anything you needed to place an identity on. This is great addition for touring shows since they load-in and load-out of theaters on a regular basis, and get different crews in different cities to help them. A way to export the updated chart data back into Vectorworks Spotlight An import export tool - Which would allow you to export your entire charts data onto a Flash drive or on to your computer that you could give to another designer to upload into there own subscription plan. Develop a way to have pictures in the Focus Charts Tab,\\xa0 Adding moving lights to the Focus Charts Tab,\\xa0 Adding a swap patch feature to the three spreadsheets. This would allow you to swap the patch between two fixture types. Same concept a lighting console uses! Adding push notifications to the work notes. This feature would send text messages to the crew when a problem was added to the work notes. Very useful when there\\'s a technical rehearsal going on and the lighting designer wants something changed ....YESTERDAY! :) It breaks my heart to say this ...but the brakes have been applied to this project because the funding has run out.I humbly, and respectfully request your help!Anything you can contribute or pledge to this project I would be eternally grateful. :)Thank you so very much from the bottom of my heart!Sincerely,Terri Batcheller        For the $2 to $50 pledges:Visit\\xa0\\xa0to see the contributors page that will be on the website for all of eternity!For the $100 and $500 pledges:You have the choice to pick the date when your FREE subscription starts.
